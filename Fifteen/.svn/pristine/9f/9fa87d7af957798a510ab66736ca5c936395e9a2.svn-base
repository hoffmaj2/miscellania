The program, when run, creats a small window containing a 4x4 puzzle.
The puzzle is layed out on a grid, with each cell containing a number from 1 to n*m-1,
where n and m are the dimensions of the grid.
The positions of the tiles are random, but are always solvable.
On one side of the grid is a row of buttons, labeled "reset", "new puzzle", "resize", "undo", and "redo"
The buttons work and will reset, resize, undo, redo, etc. the puzzle.
One tile in the grid is blank, and can be moved by clicking on the adjacent tiles.
When solved, (all of the tiles are in numerical order) the puzzle displays a short "you win" message.
